/*Advantages of Data Abstraction in C++

->Helps the user to avoid writing the low-level code.

->Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.

->Can change the internal implementation of the class independently without affecting the user.

->Helps to increase the security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user.

->It reduces the complexity as well as the redundancy of the code, therefore increasing the readability.*/
